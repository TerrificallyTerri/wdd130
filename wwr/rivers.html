                        The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people 
                        living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love
                        with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.<br>
                    <br>
                        The rapids range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest 
                        undammed rivers in the United States. <b>As a free flowing river the water is higher, 
                        faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer</b>. 
                        <br><br>There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to 
                        appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.
