            <h3>Dam Situation</h3>
            <p id='para1'>Tailings dams are notoriously dangerous, and the World Mine Tailings Failures (WMTF) predicts 19 very serious dam failures before 2027. 
                These colossal structures are built without major changes to law, regulation, or to industry practices, as well as without new technology 
                to possibly reduce risk and increase loss control. The colossal size of these dams adds to the risk they pose, the Maravilhas II dam in 
                Brazil stands 90m high and has been built up over 20 years (Vale, 2022). The common altering of these dams throughout their lifespans, 
                with the dams generally being enlarged as the mine life is extended, without proper consultation and reinforcement increases the 
                possibility that conditions could change or that supervision will fail. There is also little consequence for non-compliance with 
                laws and regulations concerning tailings dams</p>
            <p id='para2'>Dam failures release toxic substances such as arsenic, mercury, lead, cyanide, Sulphur, radionuclides, and other heavy metals 
                usually into the natural water systems such as nearby rivers and lakes which increases the spread of the toxic substances. These 
                toxic substances also leech into the ground water and topsoil causing long-term damage to water sources, food production, natural 
                fauna and flora and human settlements. Below is a table with some of the known casualty figures of dam failures:</p>

                    Mining is crucial to many countries’ economies and to the advancement of technology and as such moratoriums on mining 
                    would be premature and ill conceived. Dams are obviously not safe so what is the solution?
