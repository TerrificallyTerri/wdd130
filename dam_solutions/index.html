                    <h3>What is the Problem?</h3>
                    <p> The global demand for the products of mining continually increases. Extraction of the metals and minerals from the raw mined ores 
                        produce a significant quantity of waste material in the form of tailings which are composed of crushed rock and the processing 
                        fluids from processing plants that remain after the extraction of economic metals, minerals, mineral fuels, or coal. The volume of 
                        tailings is normally far greater than the resource which was liberated from the raw ore and the tailings often contain potentially 
                        hazardous contaminants  (D. Kossoff, 2014). </p>

                    <h3>Mining's Current Patch</h3>
                    <p> It is therefore a priority for responsible and reasonable mining organizations to proactively isolate the tailings such that they 
                        forestall them from entering groundwaters, rivers, lakes, and the wind and to control for possible chemical changes as a function 
                        of their storage. Considering expense and convenience, mining organizations have resorted to the use of tailings dams to store these 
                        tailings indefinitely. Tailings dams are some of the largest earth structures constructed by geotechnical engineers and to save costs 
                        the dams are constructed with the mining waste products and experts are not fully consulted or their recommendations are not adhered to. </p>

                    <h3>Consequences</h3>
                    <p> An estimated 3 500 active tailings dams can be found around the globe of these there was between 2 and 5 major tailings dam failures 
                        together with 35 minor failures each year as of 2013 which has doubled in the past 10 years putting communities and environments at 
                        astronomical risk (Azam, 2010). </p>
