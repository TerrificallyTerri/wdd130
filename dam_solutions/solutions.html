                <h2>Solid Liquid Separation</h2>
                <p> The separation of solids and liquids provides the basis of resolving the hazards of slimes dams.
                    Solid liquid separation
                    does pose challenges particularly for fine and ultrafine particulate matter suspended in liquid. In
                    a competitive market
                    it is critical to keep operation costs as low as possible while still maintaining the safety and
                    integrity of the communities
                    and environments surrounding the mining site.
                    <br>
                    Historical solid liquid separation options together with their high operational cost and required
                    foot space, are unable to dewater the large
                    quantities of slurry effluent produced by the processing mills, nor are they able to produce a
                    sufficiently dry product that
                    can be safely stockpiled or stored with out additional costs.

                <h2>Filter Presses</h2>
                <p> The solution is one that is both new and old. Filter presss have been used in the Shang Dynasty from
                    1600B.C. This solution works across all mining
                    mill tailings, paper mills and even sewage. The filter press feed pump pushes slurry into the filter
                    which builds pressure, solids build within the chambers
                    until they are completely chock-full of solids, forming the cake whle the liquids filter out in a
                    clear reusable filtrate. Once the chambers are full, the cycle is complete, and the
                    filter cakes are ready to be released.<br>
                    Filter presses have a simple operation procedure which can be fully automatized, they also have the
                    lowest
                    capital and operational expense requirements of all filtration systems and even slurry dams.</p>

                <h2>Resolution</h2>
                <p> Plate and frame filters provide the options of further beneficiation of valuable ores and minerals
                    from the previous waste stream
                    increasing product yield and profit. Filtrate from the filtration can be recycled back into the
                    processing mill significantly
                    reducing the raw water requirement and preserving natural water sources. The solids form dense and
                    stable filter cakes with low moisture
                    content which are easily stackable and movable allowing for backfilling of previously mined sections
                    reducing the costs of rehabilitation.
                    With governments being pressured to impose stricter regulations with regards to waste management of
                    mining mills the choice is clear:
                    plate and frame filtration will not only reduce the impact of mining on the communities and
                    environments surrounding them
                    they will also produce profit for the mining companies.</p>
