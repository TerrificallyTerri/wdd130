                What's the Problem?
            </h2>
            <h3>Home page</h3>
            <p>
                The global demand for the products of mining continually increases. Extraction of the metals and
                minerals from the raw mined ores
                produce a significant quantity of waste material in the form of tailings which are composed of crushed
                rock and the processing
                fluids from processing plants that remain after the extraction of economic metals, minerals, mineral
                fuels, or coal. The volume of
                tailings is normally far greater than the resource which was liberated from the raw ore and the tailings
                often contain potentially
                hazardous contaminants (D. Kossoff, 2014).
                <br>
                It is therefore a priority for responsible and reasonable mining organizations to proactively isolate
                the tailings such that they
                forestall them from entering groundwaters, rivers, lakes, and the wind and to control for possible
                chemical changes as a function
                of their storage. Considering expense and convenience, mining organizations have resorted to the use of
                tailings dams to store these
                tailings indefinitely. Tailings dams are some of the largest earth structures constructed by
                geotechnical engineers and to save costs
                the dams are constructed with the mining waste products and experts are not fully consulted or their
                recommendations are not adhered to.
                <br>
                Consequences
                An estimated 3 500 active tailings dams can be found around the globe of these there was between 2 and 5
                major tailings dam failures
                together with 35 minor failures each year as of 2013 which has doubled in the past 10 years putting
                communities and environments at
                astronomical risk (Azam, 2010).

            <h3>Dam Problems</h3>
            <p>
                Tailings dams are notoriously dangerous, and the World Mine Tailings Failures (WMTF) predicts 19 very
                serious dam failures before 2027.
                These colossal structures are built without major changes to law, regulation, or to industry practices,
                as well as without new technology
                to possibly reduce risk and increase loss control. The colossal size of these dams adds to the risk they
                pose, the Maravilhas II dam in
                Brazil stands 90m high and has been built up over 20 years (Vale, 2022). The common altering of these
                dams throughout their lifespans,
                with the dams generally being enlarged as the mine life is extended, without proper consultation and
                reinforcement increases the
                possibility that conditions could change or that supervision will fail. There is also little consequence
                for non-compliance with
                laws and regulations concerning tailings dams
                <br>
                Dam Problems
                Dam failure releases toxic substances such as arsenic, mercury, lead, cyanide, Sulphur, radionuclides,
                and other heavy metals
                usually into the natural water systems such as nearby rivers and lakes which increases the spread of the
                toxic substances. These
                toxic substances also leech into the ground water and topsoil causing long-term damage to water sources,
                food production, natural
                fauna and flora and human settlements. Below is a table with some of the known casualty figures of dam

            Mining is crucial to many countries’ economies and to the advancement of technology and as such moratoriums
            on mining
            would be premature and ill conceived. Dams are obviously not safe so what is the solution?

            <h3>Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                The separation of solids and liquids provides the basis of resolving the hazards of slimes dams. Solid
                liquid separation
                does pose challenges particularly for fine and ultrafine particulate matter suspended in liquid. In a
                competitive market
                it is critical to keep operation costs as low as possible while still maintaining the safety and
                integrity of the communities
                and environments surrounding the mining site.
                Common filtration Options
                Historical solid liquid separation options such as belt filters, Drum filters, thickeners, disk filters,
                pan filters, and
                centrifuges unfortunately together with their high operational cost and foot space, none of these can
                handle the large
                quantities of slurry effluent produced by the processing mills nor are they able to produce a
                sufficiently dry product that
                can be safely stockpiled or stored with out additional costs.
                Filter Presses
                The solution is one that is both new and old being used in the Shang Dynasty in 1600B.C. This solution
                works across all mining
                mill tailings, paper mills and even sewage. The working principle of filter presses is that slurry is
                pumped into the machine
                such that solids are distributed evenly during the fill cycle. Solids build up on the filter cloth,
                forming the filter cake;
                the filtrate exits the filter plates through the corner ports into the manifold, yielding clean filtered
                water. Filter presses
                are a pressure filtration method and as such, as the filter press feed pump builds pressure, solids
                build within the chambers
                until they are completely chock-full of solids, forming the cake. Once the chambers are full, the cycle
                is complete, and the
                filter cakes are ready to be released. In many higher capacity filter presses, fast action automatic
                plate shifters are employed,
                speeding cycle time. Filter presses have a simple operation procedure which can be fully automatized,
                they also have the lowest
                capital and operational expense requirements of all filtration systems and even slurry dams.
                Benefits
                Plate and frame filters provide the options of further beneficiation of valuable ores and minerals from
                the previous waste stream
                increasing product yield and profit. Filtrate from the filtration can be recycled back into the
                processing mill significantly
                reducing the raw water requirement and preserving natural water sources. The solids form dense and
                stable filter cakes with low moisture
                content which are easily stackable and movable allowing for backfilling of previously mined sections
                reducing the costs of rehabilitation.
                With governments being pressured to impose stricter regulations with regards to waste management of
                mining mills the choice is clear:
                plate and frame filtration will not only reduce the impact of mining on the communities and environments
                surrounding them
                they will also produce profit for the mining companies.
