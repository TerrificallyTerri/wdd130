    <h3>Terri</h3>
    <p>I hail from a little town in South Africa called Middelburg (GMT+2), the town is called Middelburg because ... 
        <br><em>It's in the middle</em> ðŸ¤ª.
    <p>I recently got married and my little family of 3 has grown to 6, ðŸ¦‡crazy is now the norm for me.<br>

    <br>I love reading, and am currently re-reading Hitchhikers Guide. My favourite book (series) has been "The Name of the Wind". 
    <br>Curiosity is my constant companion,
         I guess I never outgrew the "why" and "how" phase of my childhood which has 
         led me down rabbit holes. A bonus is that I am a laboratory analyst 
         in a metallurgical laboratory and as such I get to ask questions all day!
    <br>Studying through BYU is <b>GREAT</b> as I get to satisfy my need for information and get credit for it ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž.
    <br><br>My goal is a degree in Web Development, although what I am learning now is helping me to automate the majority of 
    my laboratory admin and GLP.  
    <br> I am looking forward to learning with every one here this semester!!!
